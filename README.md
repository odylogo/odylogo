- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @odylogo or Odysseas :)
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in visually pleasing web pages and climbing mountains
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular
- âš¡ "Fun fact: If I were spending the same time practicing programming as I am star-gazing, I would already be amazing in what I do."
-   I am really proud of my streak in Duolingo learning Danish
