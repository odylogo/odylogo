- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @odylogo or Odysseas :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in visually pleasing web pages and climbing mountains
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Angular
- âš¡ "Fun fact: If I were spending the same time programming as I am pre-planning what I will program in the future, I would already be a senior engineer."
-   I am really proud of my 375 days streak in Duolingo learning Norwegian
